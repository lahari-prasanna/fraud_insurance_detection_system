# Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to build an automated, data-driven system that helps insurance companies identify suspicious claims efficiently and reduce financial losses.

## Problem Statement
Manual fraud detection processes are time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.  
This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify insurance claims as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on historical data.

## Dataset Description
- Structured insurance claim dataset
- Target variable: `Fraud_Ind`
- Includes customer, vehicle, claim, and policy-related attributes
- Data split into training and testing sets

## Methodology
- Data understanding and exploratory analysis  
- Data cleaning (missing values, outliers, duplicates, data leakage prevention)  
- Feature engineering and variable selection  
- Model development and comparison  
- Hyperparameter tuning and optimization  
- Final model selection based on performance and business impact  

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
The final model effectively identifies fraudulent insurance claims and demonstrates how machine learning can assist in decision-making and risk mitigation.

## Future Scope
- Model deployment as a web application
- Integration with real-time claim processing systems
- Use of advanced ensemble and deep learning models
